<h2>What is a 'Botnet infection'?</h2>

<p>Your server has been compromised. It's hosting malware 
and is participating in a botnet.</p>

<h2>Why would this be bad?</h2>

spam, hack into other computers and launch network attacks.</p>

<h2>Recommended action</h2>

<p>This issue needs to be resolved by removing the malicious 
software.</p>

<h2>Tips to resolve this matter</h2>

<p>If you suspect a user account has been compromised, change
the password for the account immediately.</p>

<p>Scan all hosted websites and temporary directories for 
suspicious files and remove them. Also check your process
list for suspicious processes and kill them.</p>

<p>Install a rootkit and a virus scanner to ensure all malicious
files have been removed.</p>

<p>Once all malicious software has been removed make sure the 
server can't be compromised again by installing the latest
