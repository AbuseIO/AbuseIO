<h2>What is an 'Open REDIS Server'?</h2>

<p>Redis clients communicate with the Redis server using a protocol called 
RESP (REdis Serialization Protocol). While the protocol was designed 
specifically for Redis, it can be used for other client-server software 
projects.</p>

<h2>Why would this be bad?</h2>

<p>Redis is designed to be accessed by trusted clients inside trusted environments. 
This means that usually it is not a good idea to expose the Redis instance 
directly to the internet or, in general, to an environment where untrusted 
clients can directly access the Redis TCP port or UNIX socket.</p>

<p>For instance, in the common context of a web application implemented using 
Redis as a database, cache, or messaging system, the clients inside the 
frontend (web side) of the application will query Redis to generate pages or 
to perform operations requested or triggered by the web application user.</p>

<p>In this case, the web application mediates access between Redis and untrusted 
clients (the user browsers accessing the web application). This is a specific 
example, but, in general, untrusted access to Redis should always be mediated 
by a layer implementing ACLs, validating user input, and deciding what 
operations to perform against the Redis instance. In general, Redis is not 
optimized for maximum security but for maximum performance and simplicity.</p>

<h2>Recommended action</h2>

<p>Access to the Redis port should be denied to everybody but trusted clients in 
the network, so the servers running Redis should be directly accessible only 
by the computers implementing the application using Redis.</p>

<p>In the common case of a single computer directly exposed to the internet, such 
as a virtualized Linux instance (Linode, EC2, ...), the Redis port should be 
firewalled to prevent access from the outside. Clients will still be able to 
access Redis using the loopback interface.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Tips to resolve this matter</h2>

<h3>Firewalling remote access</h3>

<p>Simplest way is to block the default port TCP/6379 (or whatever port is listed
in the report) and only allow IP's that should actually have access to this service.</p>

<h3>Blocking remote access</h3>

<p>It is possible to bind Redis to a single interface by adding a line like the following to the redis.conf file:</p>

<pre>
    bind 127.0.0.1
</pre>

<h3>Enabling Authentication feature</h3>

<p>While Redis does not try to implement Access Control, it provides a tiny layer 
of authentication that is optionally turned on editing the redis.conf file. When 
the authorization layer is enabled, Redis will refuse any query by unauthenticated 
clients. A client can authenticate itself by sending the AUTH command followed by 
the password.</p>

<p>The password is set by the system administrator in clear text inside the redis.conf 
file. It should be long enough to prevent brute force attacks for two reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Redis is very fast at serving queries. Many passwords per second can be tested by an external client.</li>
<li>The Redis password is stored inside the redis.conf file and inside the client configuration, so it does not need to be remembered by the system administrator, and thus it can be very long.</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal of the authentication layer is to optionally provide a layer of redundancy. 
If firewalling or any other system implemented to protect Redis from external attackers 
fail, an external client will still not be able to access the Redis instance without 
knowledge of the authentication password. The AUTH command, like every other Redis 
command, is sent unencrypted, so it does not protect against an attacker that has 
enough access to the network to perform eavesdropping.</p>
