<h2>What is a 'Dictionary attack'?</h2>

<p>A dictionary attack is when hackers floods your mail-server with usernames (email addresses) 
selected from a dictionary in the form of emails</p>

<h2>Why would this be bad?</h2>

<p>A dictionary attack on a mail-server can cause excess load and often cause delays in email delivery 
if not properly configured. Spammers use this trick to gather list of valid email accounts. 
If your mail-server is configured to send NDR's to for non-existent users, then systems can quickly 
overload when an attack is seen.</p>

<h2>Recommended action</h2>

<p>Check your MTA's configuration and make sure it is set to reject emails to unknown recipients and not send bounces(NDR).</p>

<h2>Tips how to resolve this matter</h2>
<ul>
<li>Most major control panels (Plesk,WHM,DirectAdmin) should already do the above, if not you should change this</li>
<li>It's also recommended to make sure your domains are not set as a catch-all (accept any email address for a domain)</li>
<li>Set rate-limiting where applicable to senders who send to non-existent users</li>
</ul>
