Your IP address has been listed on a RBL (real-time block list)
and marked as an open proxy. This indicates that your server has 
been misconfigured or has been compromised.

In the case of a misconfiguration it could for example be the case 
that your SMTP server is accepting email from untrusted sources. In the 
case of a compromise your server might have been hacked or infected 
by a trojan.

If your server remains listed on the RBL you will have trouble sending 
email to certain recipients. Once you have resolved the issue, you can 
request a delisting using the URL included in the ticket reports.

You also might want to check and resolve listings on other RBL's, 
using a RBL checker such as: http://www.anti-abuse.org/multi-rbl-check/
