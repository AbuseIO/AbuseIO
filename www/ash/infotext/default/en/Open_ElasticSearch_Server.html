<h2>What is an 'Open ElasticSearch Server'?</h2>

<p>Elasticsearch is a search server based on Lucene. It provides a distributed, 
multitenant-capable full-text search engine with a RESTful web interface and 
schema-free JSON documents.</p>

<h2>Why would this be bad?</h2>

<p>Your system has an ElasticSearch instance running (see www.elastic.co for 
more information) which is accessible on the internet. On its own, ElasticSearch 
does not support authentication or restrict access to the datastore, so it is 
possible that any entity that can access the ElasticSearch instance may have 
complete control.</p>

<p>This is especially problematic if this instance has dynamic scripting running.
The scripting engine can be abused to launch a denial of service attack.</p>

<h2>Recommended action</h2>

<p>Either bind this service only to non-public facing connections or add a firewall 
to block the port ElasticSearch is running on.</p>

<h2>Tips to resolve this matter</h2>

<p>Read the ElasticSearch documentation on how to properly secure your ElasticSearch
instance.</p>
