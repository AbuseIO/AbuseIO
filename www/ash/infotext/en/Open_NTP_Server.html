<h2>What is an 'Open NTP Server'?</h2>

<p>Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a networking protocol for clock 
synchronization between computer systems over packet-switched, 
variable-latency data networks. In operation since before 1985, NTP 
is one of the oldest Internet protocols in current use.</p>

<h2>Why would this be bad?</h2>

<p>Running an open (UDP) service is not bad on its own and it is mostly
a required dependancy when installing a system.
Unfortunately, hackers have also found this feature useful in performing a
special type of DDoS attack called a 'Amplification Attack'.</p>

<p>The attacker sends a packet apparently from the intended victim to some
server on the Internet that will reply immediately. Because the source
IP address is forged, the remote Internet server replies and sends data
to the victim.</p>

<p>That has two effects: the actual source of the attack is hidden and is
very hard to trace, and, if many Internet servers are used, an attack
can consist of an overwhelming number of packets hitting a victim from
all over the world.</p>

<p>But what makes reflection attacks really powerful is when they are
also amplified: when a small forged packet elicits a large reply from
the server (or servers). In that case, an attacker can send a small
packet "from" a forged source IP address and have the server (or
servers) send large replies to the victim.</p>

<p>Amplification attacks like that result in an attacker turning a small
amount of bandwidth coming from a small number of machines into a massive
traffic load hitting a victim from around the Internet.</p>

<h2>Recommended action</h2>

<p>In most cases the computer has installed a NTP service as an dependancy
as timekeeping is needed on that computer. However its only required to do
local timekeeping, thus the added 'external access' to this service is
unneeded. In such cases we recommend either changing the configuration
of your NTP service or to firewall port 123 for external hosts.</p>

<p>If you are running a NTP Server for multiple computers, then consider
to limit access to the required group of computer or implement safegaurds
like ... to prevent a DNS Amplification Attack.</p>


<h2>Tips to resolve this matter</h2>

<h3>UNIX/Linux ntpd</h3>

<p>The following configuration is for a UNIX/Linux machine to act as simply 
an NTP client and never to allow NTP queries to it except from the loopback
address:</p>

<pre># by default act only as a basic NTP client
restrict -4 default nomodify nopeer noquery notrap
restrict -6 default nomodify nopeer noquery notrap
# allow NTP messages from the loopback address, useful for debugging
restrict 127.0.0.1
restrict ::1
# server(s) we time sync to
server 192.0.2.1
server 2001:DB8::1
server time.example.net
</pre>

<p>You can use your standard host firewall filtering capabilities to limit
who the NTP process talks to.  If you're using Linux and the host is acting
as an NTP client only, the following iptables rules could be adapted to shield
your NTP listener from unwanted remote hosts.</p>

<pre>-A INPUT -s 0/0 -d 0/0 -p udp --source-port 123:123 -m state --state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
-A OUTPUT -s 0/0 -d 0/0 -p udp --destination-port 123:123 -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
</pre>

<p>Authentication with the reference NTP software on UNIX can be done using
symmetric key encryption, much like in Cisco IOS and Juniper JUNOS, using
MD5.  However, a public key-based approach called 'AutoKey' is also
available, which is generally be considered to be even more secure.  For
more information about these options, see the <a href="http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ntp/html/authopt.html" target="_blank">NTP
authentication options page</a> and the <a href="http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Support/ConfiguringAutokey" target="_blank">Configuring
Autokey documentation</a>.</p>
