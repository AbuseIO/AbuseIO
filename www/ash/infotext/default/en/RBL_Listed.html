<h2>What does 'RBL Listed' mean?</h2>

<p>Your IP address has been listed on a RBL (real-time block list).</p>

<p>This indicates that your server has probably been sending out a 
high volume of unsolicited email, your computer or server has been 
misconfigured or has been compromised</p>

<h2>Why would this be bad?</h2>

<p>Depending on the problem, your server can potentially be used by malicous
users on the internet to send spam or do harm to others while using your
server as a proxy.</p>

<p>If your server remains listed on this RBL you will have trouble 
sending email to lots of recipients.</p>

<h2>Recommended action</h2>

<p>In the case of a misconfiguration it could for example be the case
that your SMTP server is accepting email from untrusted sources and you
will need to reconfigure your SMTP server.</p>

<p>In the case of a compromise your server might have been hacked or infected
by a trojan.</p>

<p>If you have been accidently listed and have resolved the issue, you
can request a delisting using the URL included in the ticket report. Do
not attempt to request a delisting at a RBL without knowning for sure you
have resolved the issue. If you request a delisting without solving the 
problem you might end up permanently listed on that RBL!</p>

<h2>Tips to resolve this matter</h2>

<p>Run a virus and/or malware scanner on the system to look for infections</p>

<p>You also might want to check and resolve listings on other RBL's, 
using a RBL checker such as: http://www.anti-abuse.org/multi-rbl-check/</p>
