<h2>What is a SPAM Trap?</h2>

<p>A SpamTrap is a honeypot used to collect spam.</p>

<h2>Why would sending email to these this be bad?</h2>

<p>SpamTraps are generally e-mail addresses that are made to recieve spam. 
SpamTraps are often hidden from view on websites, so that they are only harvested from automated scans. 
Since no "legit" e-mail is ever sent to this address, any e-mail's that are sent to the Spam-Traps are 
immediately considered unsolicited.</p>

<h2>Recommended action</h2>

<p>Clean up your mailing lists. Configure your "Hard & Soft" Bounce values to 
correctly remove recipient's when needed.</p>

<p>If you are not sending bulk email, then check your website and DNS
for signs of comprimise. </p>

<h2>Tips how to resolve this matter</h2>

<p>When cleaning your mailing lists there are some thing that you can already do:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Remove malformed domain names</li>
	<li>Remove role accounts (sales@example.com, accounts@example.net)</li>
	<li>Adhere to the unsubscribe process</li>
	<li>Never buy a mailing list</li>
	<li>Use double opt-in</li>
</ul>

<p>The best way to solve the problem is to stop your mailserver(MTA)
and investigate the mail queues for SPAM messages. When you found an
example you can open it to identify its source. By stopping the MTA
you will prevent SPAM from being sent out. After solving the problem
you must clean your mail queue from all these SPAM messages before
starting your MTA again.</p>
