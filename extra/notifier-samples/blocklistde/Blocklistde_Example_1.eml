Hello Abuse-Team,

your Server/Customer with the IP: *10.0.2.150* has attacked one of our servers/partners.
The attackers used the method/service: *regbot*  on: *Fri, 31 Jan 2014 07:19:02 +0100*.
The time listed is from the server-time of the Blocklist-user who submitted the report.
The attack was reported to the Blocklist.de-System on: *Fri, 31 Jan 2014 07:25:24 +0100*

The IP has been automatically blocked for a period of time. For an IP to be blocked, it needs
to have made several failed logins (ssh, imap....), tried to log in for an "invalid user", or have
triggered several 5xx-Error-Codes (eg. Blacklist on email...), all during a short period of time.
The Server-Owner configures the number of failed attempts, and the time period they have
to occur in, in order to trigger a ban and report. Blocklist has no control over these settings.
He has registered automatically on a honeypot Wiki/Forum/Blog-System....
At the site there is a notice that all postings and registrations will be reported.
He used xrumer or other Tools or had a false configured mod_rewrite/mod_proxy who is abused:
