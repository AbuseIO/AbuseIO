<h2>What is an 'Open SSDP Server'?</h2>

<p>The Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP) is a network protocol 
based on the Internet Protocol Suite for advertisement and discovery of 
network services and presence information. It accomplishes this without 
assistance of server-based configuration mechanisms, such as the Dynamic 
Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) or the Domain Name System (DNS), and 
without special static configuration of a network host. SSDP is the basis 
of the discovery protocol of Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) and is 
intended for use in residential or small office environments.</p>

<h2>Why would this be bad?</h2>

<p>Running an open (UDP) service is not bad on its own and it is mostly
a required dependancy when installing a system.
Unfortunately, hackers have also found this feature useful in performing a
special type of DDoS attack called a 'Amplification Attack'.</p>

<p>The attacker sends a packet apparently from the intended victim to some
server on the Internet that will reply immediately. Because the source
IP address is forged, the remote Internet server replies and sends data
to the victim.</p>

<p>That has two effects: the actual source of the attack is hidden and is
very hard to trace, and, if many Internet servers are used, an attack
can consist of an overwhelming number of packets hitting a victim from
all over the world.</p>

<p>But what makes reflection attacks really powerful is when they are
also amplified: when a small forged packet elicits a large reply from
the server (or servers). In that case, an attacker can send a small
packet "from" a forged source IP address and have the server (or
servers) send large replies to the victim.</p>

<p>Amplification attacks like that result in an attacker turning a small
amount of bandwidth coming from a small number of machines into a massive
traffic load hitting a victim from around the Internet.</p>

<h2>Recommended action</h2>

<p>There is no reason to have this CHARGEN service enabled on a public facing
interface. You should either stop te service or make sure it is not reachable
from the internet by using RFC1918 spaces or a firewall.</p>
