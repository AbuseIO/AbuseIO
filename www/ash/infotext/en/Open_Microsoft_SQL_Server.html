<h2>What is an 'Open Microsoft SQL Server'?</h2>

<p>Microsoft SQL Server is a relational database management system developed 
by Microsoft. As a database, it is a software product whose primary function 
is to store and retrieve data as requested by other software applications, 
be it those on the same computer or those running on another computer across 
a network (including the Internet). There are at least a dozen different 
editions of Microsoft SQL Server aimed at different audiences and for 
workloads ranging from small single-machine applications to large 
Internet-facing applications with many concurrent users. Its primary query 
languages are T-SQL and ANSI SQL.</p>

<h2>Why would this be bad?</h2>

<p>This service has the potential to expose information about a clients network 
on which this service is accessible and the service itself can be used in UDP 
amplification attacks. In addition it opens up your system to 0-day attacks or 
worm/virus infections that exploit a vulnarability in Windows to gain access 
to your system.</p>

<h2>Recommended action</h2>

<p>Either use the Windows Firewall or even better an external firewall to prevent 
access to Netbios (and other Windows ports). The windows firewall has an nasty 
way of trying to think for himself and for example automaticly starts to open 
ports if you install something that uses Netbios. In all cases the 
administrator is unaware of these open ports.</p>
