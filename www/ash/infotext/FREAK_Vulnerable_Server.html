<h2>What is a 'FREAK Vulnarable Server'?</h2>

Servers that accept RSA_EXPORT cipher suites put their users at risk from the FREAK 
attack. Using Internet-wide scanning, we have been performing daily tests of all 
HTTPS servers at public IP addresses to determine whether they allow this weakened 
encryption. More than a third of all servers with browser-trusted certificates are 
at risk.

<h2>Why would this be bad?</h2>

Servers that accept RSA_EXPORT cipher suites put their users at risk from the FREAK 
attack. The FREAK attack is possible when a vulnerable browser connects to a 
susceptible web server—a server that accepts “export-grade” encryption.

It allows an attacker to intercept HTTPS connections between vulnerable clients and 
servers and force them to use weakened encryption, which the attacker can break to 
steal or manipulate sensitive data. 

The factoring of such 512-bit export keys can be done with a cluster of EC2 virtual 
servers, and can be done in about 7.5 hours for $104 in EC2 time. The attacker 
factors the RSA modulus to recover the corresponding RSA decryption key. When the 
client encrypts the 'pre-master secret' to the server, the attacker can now decrypt 
it to recover the TLS 'master secret'. From here on out, the attacker sees plaintext 
and can inject anything it wants.

<h2>Recommended action</h2>

You should immediately disable support for TLS export cipher suites. While you’re 
at it, you should also disable other cipher suites that are known to be insecure 
and enable forward secrecy. For instructions on how to secure popular HTTPS server 
software, we recommend Mozilla’s 
<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#Recommended_configurations">security configuration guide</a> 
and their <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/server-side-tls/ssl-config-generator/">SSL configuration generator</a>. 
We also recommend testing your configuration with the Qualys SSL Labs 
<a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/">SSL Server Test</a> tool.

<h2>Tips how to resolve this matter</h2>

With apache server add the following to your SSL section(s):

SSLCipherSuite ALL:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!RC4:!MD5:!PSK
