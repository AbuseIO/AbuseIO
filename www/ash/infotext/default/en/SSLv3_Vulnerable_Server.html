<h2>What is a 'SSLv3 Vulnerable Server'?</h2>

<p>POODLE (the 'Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption' attack) is the name for an
OpenSSL bug. This bug impacts almost every system using any kind of encryption which is
based on OpenSSL.</p>

<h2>Why would this be bad?</h2>

<p>The whole issue ultimately hinges on the site supporting SSLv3 and the attacker being 
able to downgrade the client to use SSLv3. These protocol downgrade attacks are old news 
and are still surfacing to cause problems. By simulating a failure during the negotiation 
process, an attacker can force a browser and a server to renegotiate using an older 
protocol, right back down to SSLv3. As the POODLE vulnerability is actually in the 
protocol itself, this isn't something that can be patched out like ShellShock and 
HeartBleed.</p>

<p>The attack, specifically against the SSLv3 protocol, allows an attacker to obtain the 
plaintext of certain parts of an SSL connection, such as the cookie. Similar to BEAST, but
more practical to carry out. Every server that is not patched for this bug is
vulnarable for such attacks.</p>

<h2>Recommended action</h2>

<p>The easiest and most robust solution to POODLE is to disable SSLv3 support on your server. 
This does bring with it a couple of caveats though. For web traffic, there are some legacy 
systems out there that won't be able to connect with anything other than SSLv3. For example, 
systems using IE6 and Windows XP installations without SP3, will no longer be able to 
communicate with any site that ditches SSLv3. According to figures released by CloudFlare, 
who have completely disabled SSLv3 across their entire customer estate, only a tiny fraction 
of their web traffic will be affected as 98.88% of Windows XP users connect with TLSv1.0 or 
better.</p>

<h2>Tips how to resolve this matter</h2>

<h3>Nginx</h3>

<p>ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;

Similar to the Apache config above, you will get TLSv1.0+ support and no SSL. You can check the config and restart.

sudo nginx -t

sudo service nginx restart</p>

<h3>IIS</h3>

<p>This one requires some registry tweaks and a server reboot but still isn’t all that bad. 
Microsoft have a support article with the required information, but all you need to do is 
modify/create a registry DWORD value.

HKey_Local_Machine\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders \SCHANNEL\Protocols

Inside protocols you will most likely have an SSL 2.0 key already, so create SSL 3.0 
alongside it if needed. Under that create a Server key and inside there a DWORD value called 
Enabled with value 0. Once that’s done reboot the server for the changes to take effect.</p>
 
<h3>Apache</h3>

<p>To disable SSLv3 on your Apache server you can configure it using the following.

SSLProtocol All -SSLv2 -SSLv3

This will give you support for TLSv1.0, TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2, but explicitly removes support for SSLv2 and SSLv3. Check the config and then restart Apache.

apachectl configtest

sudo service apache2 restart</p>


<p>After patching all the service(s) and confirming the bug is nog longer present on
your system its highly recommended to get a NEW SSL certificate (including key, csr, etc)
as it might have been comprised. Most SSL suppliers will issue such a certificate for free</p>
