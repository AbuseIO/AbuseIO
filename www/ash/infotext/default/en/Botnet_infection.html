<h2>What is a 'Botnet infection'?</h2>

<p>Botnet is a portmanteau derived from the words robot and network. Bot refers 
to a computer program that independently performs automated jobs. Such programs 
have many legitimate uses; search engines, for example, commonly use bots to 
catalogue web sites. Unfortunately, bots can also be programmed to perform 
malicious actions on systems. A botnet is a large group of infected computers 
connected to each other via the internet. Criminals administering the botnet 
make sure that the the programs get installed on as many systems as possible. 
The programs stay under the radar, generally running in the background, and are 
usually difficult for antivirus software to identify. Once a computer is infected, 
it can then become part of the botnet through the exploitation of vulnerabilities 
in software installed on the user's system. There are many avenues for this 
infection, such as visiting a (generally infected) web site, 'drive-by downloads' 
(when malware is downloaded and installed on the system without the user's knowledge), 
and even by simply clicking attachments or links in an e-mail or merely connecting 
peripherals such as USB sticks or external hard drives to the system.</p>

<h2>Why would this be bad?</h2>

<p>The IP listed in the report (the system behind it using NAT), has seen
participating inside the botnet. With your system in communication with the
botnet you can be 99,9% sure it has been compromised. It's hosting malware 
and is participating in a botnet.</p>

<p>A botnet can be used to steal your personal data, send 
spam, hack into other computers and launch network attacks. In these examples
you are the actual source of these attacks!</p>

<h2>Recommended action</h2>

<p>This issue needs to be resolved by removing the malicious software. In 
very persistant infections you will need to reinstall the system to get rid
of the infection.</p>

<h2>Tips to resolve this matter</h2>

<p>If your system is a workstation or server:<ul>
<li>Install including all updates an antivirus software and run a full scan of your computer. 
It's recommended to try several scanners as not every scanner is able to detect a specific
kind of malware.</li>
<li>Scan the network for infected files. Don't forget to scan the backups, as well as any 
computers that may have been "off" for the last little while because of employee vacation, 
etc.</li>
<li>Users of any system with a botnet infection should change all their passwords as quickly 
as possible. This should include any passwords saved locally and used to access other systems 
and applications (including business applications, access to web site administrator accounts, 
personal use of e-mail and social media, etc.).</li>
<li>If a computer is infected with malware, there is a significant chance that other malware is 
also present on the system. A clean reinstall will help prevent any other infections from 
having free access to the network.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>If your system is a website / hosting system:<ul>
<li>If you suspect a user account has been compromised, change the password for the account 
immediately.</li>
<li>Scan all hosted websites and temporary directories for suspicious files and remove them. 
Also check your process list for suspicious processes and kill them.</li>
<li>Check your mail queues for outgoing SPAM and remove them for the queue.</li>
<li>Install a rootkit and a virus scanner to ensure all malicious files have been removed.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Once all malicious software has been removed make sure the server can't be compromised again 
by installing the latest updates for your operating system, control panel and hosted 
applications, including themes and plugins (i.e. Wordpress). If you do not upgrade them 
directly you will face a re-infection in a very short time!</p>
