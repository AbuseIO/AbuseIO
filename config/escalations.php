    | tickets will be created by the parser als 'info' and will process when
    | the thresholds are hit.
    |
    | Using the info at the ticket start, you will have a less agressive
    | notification cycle (once in every 90 days). Once there are 25 or more
    | complaints we consider the 'false-positive' factor gone and upgrade it to
    | abuse which will start real-time notifications.
    | After the escaltion threshold is hit it will move the status to escalated
    | which can be use for automatic quarantining stuff.
