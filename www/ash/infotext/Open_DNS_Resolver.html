<h2>What is an 'Open DNS Resolver'?</h2>

An open DNS server is a DNS server which is willing to resolve
recursive DNS queries for anyone on the Internet.

When a DNS server resolves a recursive DNS query, it tracks down
information about a domain name hosted on some other DNS server
somewhere else on the Internet (a recursive process involving
several other DNS servers in the DNS hierarchy).

<h2>Why would this be bad?</h2>

Running an open (UDP) service is not bad on its own and it is mostly
a required dependancy when installing a system.
Unfortunately, hackers have also found this feature useful in performing a
special type of DDoS attack called a 'Amplification Attack'.

The attacker sends a packet apparently from the intended victim to some
server on the Internet that will reply immediately. Because the source
IP address is forged, the remote Internet server replies and sends data
to the victim.

That has two effects: the actual source of the attack is hidden and is
very hard to trace, and, if many Internet servers are used, an attack
can consist of an overwhelming number of packets hitting a victim from
all over the world.

But what makes reflection attacks really powerful is when they are
also amplified: when a small forged packet elicits a large reply from
the server (or servers). In that case, an attacker can send a small
packet "from" a forged source IP address and have the server (or
servers) send large replies to the victim.

Amplification attacks like that result in an attacker turning a small
amount of bandwidth coming from a small number of machines into a massive
traffic load hitting a victim from around the Internet.

<h2>Recommended action</h2>

In most cases the computer has installed a DNS service as an dependancy
as resolving is needed on that computer. However its only required to do
local resolving, thus the added 'external access' to this service is 
unneeded. In such cases we recommend either changing the configuration
of your DNS service or to firewall port 53 for external hosts.

If you are running a DNS resolver for multiple computers, then consider
to limit access to the required group of computer or implement safegaurds
like 'Response Rate Limiting'(DNS-RRL) to prevent a DNS Amplification Attack.

<h2>Tips to resolve this matter</h2>

<h3>Firewalling the DNS Service</h3>

To block incoming remote requests you will need to filter UDP/port 53. You
service might also be listening on TCP/port 53, however only UDP services
are used in DNS Amplification Attacks. 

<h3>Bind 9.x Authoritative</h3>

For BIND 9.x authoritative servers, apply the following global options:
<br>
<code>
  options {
      recursion no;
      additional-from-cache no;
  };
</code>
<br>
Beginning with BIND versions 9.4 and later, most configurations would default to a closed resolver. Those running earlier versions should upgrade if possible.<br>
<br>
<h3>Bind 9.x Caching</h3>

For BIND 9.x caching servers, additionally create access control lists and use "views" to explicitly permit a limited set of source addresses from your trusted network issue queries to your caching server:
<code>
  # example only, replace 192.0.2.0/24 a list of your CIDR blocks
  acl "trusted" {
      192.0.2.0/24;
  };

  options {
      recursion no;
      additional-from-cache no;
      allow-query { none; };
  };

  view "trusted" in {
      match-clients { trusted; };
      allow-query { trusted; };
      recursion yes;
      additional-from-cache yes;
  };
</code>
