<h2>What is a SPAM Trap?</h2>

<p>A SpamTrap is a honeypot used to collect spam.</p>

<h2>Why would sending email to these this be bad?</h2>

<p>SpamTraps are generally e-mail addresses that are made to recieve spam. 
SpamTraps are often hidden from view on websites, so that they are only harvested from automated scans. 
Since no "legit" e-mail is ever sent to this address, any e-mail's that are sent to the Spam-Traps are 
immediately considered unsolicited.</p>

<h2>Recommended action</h2>

<p>Clean up your mailing lists. Configure your "Hard & Soft" Bounce values to 
correctly remove recipient's when needed.</p>

<h2>Tips how to resolve this matter</h2>

<p>When cleaning your mailing lists there are some thing that you can already do:</p>

<ul>
