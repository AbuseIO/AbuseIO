<h2>What is 'Harvesting'?</h2>

or "harvesters", which spider web pages, mailing list archives, internet 
forums and other online sources to obtain email addresses from public data.</p>

<p>Another method addresses, known as a directory harvest attack, works 
by connecting to mailservers and guessing an email address using common 
usernames in email addresses at that domain.</p>
