<h2>What is an 'Open Netbios server'?</h2>

<p>NetBIOS is a transport protocol that Microsoft Windows systems use to share 
resources.  For example, if a PC running Windows wants to connect to and access a 
share on a file server, it probably uses NetBIOS.  There have been some changes in 
recent days, however, that allow this connection without it.  SMB, the method used 
to access file and printer shares, can also run independently of NetBIOS over TCP 
ports 139 and 445.  Both of these approaches, however, tend to increase the attack 
surface of a network.</p>

<h2>Why would this be bad?</h2>

<p>The ports that that are open to the Internet are UDP/137, UDP/138, and TCP/139. 
Unfortunately, the most popular attacker target is NetBIOS and against these 
ports.</p>

<p>Once an attacker discovers an active port 139 on a device, he can run NBSTAT to 
begin the very important first step of an attack—footprinting.  With the NBSTAT 
command, he can obtain some or all of the following information:</p>

<ul>
<li>Computer name</li>
<li>Contents of the remote name cache, including IP addresses</li>
<li>A list of local NetBIOS names</li>
<li>A list of names resolved by broadcast or via WINS</li>
<li>Contents of the session table with the destination IP addresses</li>
</ul>

<p>With this information, the attacker has information about the OS, services, and major 
applications running on the system. He also has private IP addresses that the LAN/WAN 
and security engineers have tried hard to hide behind NAT.  And that’s not all.  The 
lists provided by running NBSTAT also include user IDs.</p>

<p>If null sessions are allowed against IPC$, it isn’t difficult to take the next step 
and connect to the target device.  This connection provides a list of all available 
shares.</p>

<p>These services have the potential to be used in amplification attacks by criminals 
that wish to perform denial of service attacks. In addition it opens up your system 
to 0-day attacks or worm/virus infections that exploit a vulnarability in Windows to 
gain access to your system.</p>

<h2>Recommended action</h2>

<p>Either use the Windows Firewall or even better an external firewall to prevent access 
to Netbios (and other Windows ports). The windows firewall has an nasty way of trying 
to think for himself and for example automaticly starts to open ports if you install 
something that uses Netbios. In all cases the administrator is unaware of these open 
ports.</p>

<p>If you really need NETBIOS open for the entire world, then ensure that the exposed 
system(s) are hardened by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disabling the system’s ability to support null sessions</li>
<li>Defining very strong passwords for the local administrator accounts</li>
<li>Defining very strong passwords for shares, assuming you absolutely have to have shares on exposed systems</li>
<li>Keeping the Guest account disabled</li>
<li>Under no circumstances allowing access to the root of a hard drive via a share</li>
<li>Under no circumstances sharing the Windows or WinNT directories or any directory located beneath them</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tips to resolve this matter</h2>

<p>In a privileged DOS box run the following commands:</p>

netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="NetBIOS UDP Port 137" dir=in action=deny protocol=UDP localport=137<br>
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="NetBIOS UDP Port 137" dir=out action=deny protocol=UDP localport=137<br>
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="NetBIOS UDP Port 138" dir=in action=deny protocol=UDP localport=138<br>
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="NetBIOS UDP Port 138" dir=out action=deny protocol=UDP localport=138<br>
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="NetBIOS TCP Port 139" dir=in action=deny protocol=TCP localport=139<br>
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="NetBIOS TCP Port 139" dir=out action=deny protocol=TCP localport=139<br>
