<h2>What is a 'Open TFTP Server'?</h2>

<p>Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is a simple File Transfer Protocol
which allows a client to get from or put a file onto a remote host. One of
its primary uses is in the early stages of nodes booting from a local area
network. TFTP has been used for this application because it is very simple
to implement.</p>

<h2>Why would this be bad?</h2>

<p>TFTP has no authentication or encryption. This makes it easy for someone
to download all your configurations or even upload malicious firmware!</p>

<h2>Recommended action</h2>

<p>There is no reason to have this TFTP service enabled on a public facing
interface. You should either stop te service or make sure it is not reachable
from the internet by using RFC1918 spaces or a firewall.</p>
