Mr. Bryan A. Morgan
INSPECTION UNIT
Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.
Private Email: ryanorgan@outlook.com

Attention: 

I am Mr. Bryan A. Morgan Director Inspection Unit Counter Terrorist Unit Inspection Agent in Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport Atlanta, Georgia. During our investigation, I discovered an abandoned shipment from a Diplomat, who came from United Kingdom under a ISHIP FORWARDERS Company and it was transferred from JF Kennedy Airport to one of our facility TX. and when scanned it revealed an undisclosed sum of money in a Metal Trunk Box weighing approximately 110kg each.

The consignment was abandoned because, the Content was not properly declared by the consignee as money rather it was declared as personal effect to avoid diversion by the Shipping Agent also the Diplomat who convey the Consignment to U.S inability to pay for Non Inspection Fees.


On my assumption, each of the boxes will contain more than $5 to 6M and the consignment is still left in storage house till today through a registered shipping Company, Courier Dispatch Service Limited a division of Tran guard LTD. The Consignment are two metal boxes with weight of 110kg each (Internal dimension: W61 x H156 x D73 (cm). Effective capacity: 680 L.)Approximately, the details of the consignment including your name are tagged on the Metal Trunk box.


So, what I need from you is to re-confirm to me your Phone Number, your physical address, name of the nearest Airport around you and other details or disregard. You can send the required details to me for onward delivery.

All communication must be held extremely confidential. I can get everything concluded within 72Hrs and proceed to your physical address for delivery.

But I must get assurance from you concerning my 50% before we proceed. I want us to transact this business and share the money, since the shipper has abandoned it and ran away. I will pay for Non inspection fee and arrange for the boxes to be moved out from the storage house to your physical address, Once we are through with all arrangement, I will deploy the services of a secured shipping Company geared to provide the security it needs to your doorstep, or I can bring it by myself to avoid any more trouble.


But, I will share it 50% to you and 50% to me. You have to assure me of my 50%,If you agreed with my condition, Below are my direct email address and I wait to hear from you.

Get back to me on my private Email address ( ryanorgan@outlook.com )

Regards,

Mr. Bryan A. Morgan 
Director Counter Terrorist Unit.
Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.
