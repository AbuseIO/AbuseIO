<h2>What is an 'Open Netbios server'?</h2>

<p>NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System) is a program that allows applications 
on different computers to communicate within a local area network (LAN). Its a 
integrated part of Windows for use with for example File Sharing.</p>

<h2>Why would this be bad?</h2>

<p>These services have the potential to be used in amplification attacks by criminals 
that wish to perform denial of service attacks. In addition it opens up your system 
to 0-day attacks or worm/virus infections that exploit a vulnarability in Windows to 
gain access to your system.</p>

<h2>Recommended action</h2>

<p>Either use the Windows Firewall or even better an external firewall to prevent access 
to Netbios (and other Windows ports). The windows firewall has an nasty way of trying 
to think for himself and for example automaticly starts to open ports if you install 
something that uses Netbios. In all cases the administrator is unaware of these open 
ports.</p>
