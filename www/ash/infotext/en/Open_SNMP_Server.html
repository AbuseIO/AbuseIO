<h2>What is an 'Open SNMP Server'?</h2>

<p>Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a popular protocol for network 
management. It is used for collecting information from, and configuring, 
network devices, such as servers, printers, hubs, switches, and routers on an 
Internet Protocol (IP) network.</p>

<h2>Why would this be bad?</h2>

<p>Open SNMP Servers can be used to collect privileged information from the 
system or even to write new 'settings' to the system if not correctly
configured.</p>

<p>In addition running an open (UDP) service is not bad on its own and it 
is mostly a required dependancy when installing a system.
Unfortunately, hackers have also found this feature useful in performing a
special type of DDoS attack called a 'Amplification Attack'.</p>

<p>The attacker sends a packet apparently from the intended victim to some
server on the Internet that will reply immediately. Because the source
IP address is forged, the remote Internet server replies and sends data
to the victim.</p>

<p>That has two effects: the actual source of the attack is hidden and is
very hard to trace, and, if many Internet servers are used, an attack
can consist of an overwhelming number of packets hitting a victim from
all over the world.</p>

<p>But what makes reflection attacks really powerful is when they are
also amplified: when a small forged packet elicits a large reply from
the server (or servers). In that case, an attacker can send a small
packet "from" a forged source IP address and have the server (or
servers) send large replies to the victim.</p>

<p>Amplification attacks like that result in an attacker turning a small
amount of bandwidth coming from a small number of machines into a massive
traffic load hitting a victim from around the Internet.</p>

<h2>Recommended action</h2>

<ul>
<li>Use firewalling to block UDP/161 entirely or only allow the hosts that
need access to this service</li>
<li>Update the SNMP configuration to use a different community string then public. Something
strong like ThisIsMyCommunity$tring</li>
<li>Update the SNMP configuration to use a host based ACL's in combination with either the 'public'
community or a string thats more 'secure'</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tips to resolve this matter</h2>

<h3>Windows</h3>
<ul>
<li>Click on Windows Key > Administrative Tools > Services.</li>
<li>Right click on SNMP Service and click on Properties.</li>
<li>Click on the Security tab.</li>
<li>Type your randomized 8 - 10 character connection string. Be sure to make it Read Only, not Read Write.</li>
<li>Click on Add.</li>
<li>Click on OK.</li>
<li>Finally restart the SNMP service</li>
</ul>

<h3>Linux</h3>
<p>Edit the SNMP configuration file, which is useally located at: /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf<p>

<p>Change/Modify line(s) as follows:</p>
<p>Find the following Line:</p>
<pre>com2sec notConfigUser  default       public</pre>
Replace with (make sure you replace 192.168.0.0/24 with your network/subnet) the following lines:
<pre>com2sec local     localhost           public
com2sec mynetwork 192.168.0.0/24      public</pre>
<p>Scroll down a bit and change :</p>
<p>Find Lines:</p>
<pre>group   notConfigGroup v1           notConfigUser
group   notConfigGroup v2c           notConfigUser</pre>
<p>Replace with:</p>
<pre>group MyRWGroup v1         local
group MyRWGroup v2c        local
group MyRWGroup usm        local
group MyROGroup v1         mynetwork
group MyROGroup v2c        mynetwork
group MyROGroup usm        mynetwork</pre>
<p>Again scroll down a bit and locate the following line:</p>
<p>Find line:</p>
<pre>view    systemview     included      system</pre>
<p>Replace with:</p>
<pre>view all    included  .1                               80</pre>
<p>Again scroll down a bit and change the following line:</p>
<p>Find line:</p>
<pre>access  notConfigGroup ""      any       noauth    exact  systemview none none</pre>
<p>Replace with:</p>
<pre>access MyROGroup ""      any       noauth    exact  all    none   none<br>access MyRWGroup ""      any       noauth    exact  all    all    none</pre>
<p>Scroll down a bit and change the following lines:</p>
<p>Find lines:</p>
<pre>syslocation Unknown (edit /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf)
syscontact Root <root@localhost> (configure /etc/snmp/snmp.local.conf)</root@localhost></pre>
<b>Replace with (make sure you supply appropriate values), for example:</b>
<pre>syslocation Linux (RH3_UP2), Home Linux Router.<br>syscontact YourNameHere &lt;you@example.com&gt;</pre>

<p>restart your snmp server and test it</p>
