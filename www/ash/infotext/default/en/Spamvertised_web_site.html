<h2>What is a 'Spamvertised web site'?</h2>

<p>A site that is being "spamvertised" means that the site is being included as a link in spam emails.</p>

<p>This is generally the case when your site (or DNS) has been comprimised in some way. 
Spammers or hackers often add a redirect from your site to their Spam site. 
Spammers would prefer to use your website for their links, as most likely their site is already known as bad. </p>

<h2>Recommended action</h2>

<p>Check your website and DNS for signs of comprimise. </p>

<h2>Tips on how to resolve this</h2>

<li>If this is a CMS (WordPress, Drupal, Joomla etc), check the addons/plugins and update where possible.</li>
<li>If this is a standard website, check for signs of infection or unknown links on webpages and take the nessesary action.</li>
<li>If infection is found and resolved, begin to delist your URL on the relevant delist's.</li>
</ul>
