<h2>What is 'Spam'?</h2>

<p>A spam report indicates that one or more emails sent from
your server have been flagged by an automated system or 
by an end recipient as spam or unsolicited email.</p>

<h2>Why would this be bad?</h2>

<p>Sending spam or unsolicited email is illegal and not allowed 
by our terms of service.</p>

<h2>Recommended action</h2>

<p>If you are indeed sending bulk email, please ensure you follow
these bulk email rules to prevent your email from being flagged 
as spam:</p>

<ul>
    <li>1) Your recipients have opted in for the service.</li>
    <li>2) Each email sent contains a working opt-out link.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are not sending bulk email, then check your website and DNS 
for signs of comprimise. </p>

<h2>Tips to resolve this matter</h2>

<p>If the server should not be sending much or any email, this spam 
report could indicate that your server has been compromised.</p>

<p>The best way to solve the problem is to stop your mailserver(MTA) 
and investigate the mail queues for SPAM messages. When you found an
example you can open it to identify its source. By stopping the MTA
you will prevent SPAM from being sent out. After solving the problem
you must clean your mail queue from all these SPAM messages before
starting your MTA again.</p>
