Dear abuse team,

please have a look on these perhaps offending viruses sites(1) so far.

Notice: We do NOT urge you to shutdown your customer, but to inform him about a possible infection/misbehavior !

Please preserve on any reply our Subject: [clean-mx-viruses-81328588](fdf1:cb9d:f59e:19b0:45ff:0:0:1)-->(abuseio@domain.tld) viruses sites (1  so far) within your network, please close them!  status: As of 2015-09-15 02:16:17 CEST

(for full uri, please scroll to the right end ...

This information has been generated out of our comprehensive real time database, tracking worldwide viruses URI's

If your review this list of offending site(s), please do this carefully, pay attention for redirects also!
Also, please consider this particular machines may have a root kit installed !
So simply deleting some files or dirs or disabling cgi may not really solve the issue !

Advice: The appearance of a Virus Site on a server means that
someone intruded into the system. The server's owner should
disconnect and not return the system into service until an
audit is performed to ensure no data was lost, that all OS and
internet software is up to date with the latest security fixes,
and that any backdoors and other exploits left by the intruders
are closed. Logs should be preserved and analyzed and, perhaps,
the appropriate law enforcement agencies notified.

DO NOT JUST DELETE THE FILES. IF YOU DO NOT FIX THE SECURITY
PROBLEM, THEY WILL BE BACK!

You may forward my information to law enforcement, CERTs,
other responsible admins, or similar agencies.
