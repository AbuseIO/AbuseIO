<h2>What is 'Spam'?</h2>

<p>A spam report indicates that one or more emails sent from
your server have been flagged by an automated system or 
by an end recipient as spam or unsolicited email.</p>

<h2>Why would this be bad?</h2>

<p>Sending spam or unsolicited email is illegal and not allowed 
by our terms of service.</p>

<h2>Recommended action</h2>

<p>If you are indeed sending bulk email, please ensure you follow
these bulk email rules to prevent your email from being flagged 
as spam:</p>

<ul>
    <li>1) Your recipients have opted in for the service.</li>
    <li>2) Each email sent contains a working opt-out link.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tips to resolve this matter</h2>

<p>If the server should not be sending much or any email, this spam 
report could indicate that your server has been compromised.</p>
