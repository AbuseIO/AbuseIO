<h2>What is a 'Phishing website'?</h2>

<p>A Phishing website is the attempt to acquire sensitive information such as 
usernames, passwords, and credit card details (and sometimes, indirectly, money) 
by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication. 
Communications purporting to be from popular social web sites, auction sites, banks, 
online payment processors or IT administrators are commonly used to lure unsuspecting 
public. Phishing emails may contain links to websites that are infected with malware. </p>

<h2>Why would this be bad?</h2>

<p>A Phishing website is usually the result of a comprimised website or comprimised user
credentials of that website.</p>

<p>When your website is compromised, not only your website contains changes done by hackers
but it also contains one or more security problems that allowed a hacker to gain access
to your website in the first place. The compromised website provides a useful platform for
a range of illicit activities.</p>

<h2>Recommended action</h2>

<p>If your site has been hacked or infected with malware, you should act quickly to repair the
damage. First take your entire website offline first. This is pretty impopulair, however if
you consider the fact your might be leaking privacy information or infecting the
systems of your visitors you want to act as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>After you closed your website you will need to clean up the changed area's of your
website.</p>


<h2>Tips how to resolve this matter</h2>

<p>The safest way to clean the hacked website is to delete it entirely and then upload
a known clean version of it.</p>

<ul>
<li>Look for files that have been changed recently or on times your developers are
closed and not placing updates on the website<li>
<li>Look in temporally folders for (executable) scripts</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition future risk of compromise can be reduced by following these basic tips: </p>

<ul>
<li>Keep software and all plug-ins updated. Whether you run popular content
management software (e.g., WordPress, Joomla, Blogger) or custom software,
make sure that software and all third party plug-ins or extensions are updated.
Remove plug-i ns or other add-ons that aren’t in use</li>
<li>Use strong, varied passwords. WordPress login credentials, for example,
should be different from FTP credentials. Never store passwords on your local
machine.</li>
<li>Regularly scan your PC for malware and your website for unautherized changes</li>
<li>Use appropriate file permissions on your web server.</li>
<li>Research your options and make security a priority when choosing a web hosting
provider. If you aren’t confident you can protect your site on your own, consider
using an add-on security service from your hosting provider or a third party website
security service.</li>
</ul>
