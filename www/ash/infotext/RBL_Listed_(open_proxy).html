<h2>What does 'RBL Listed (open proxy)' mean?</h2>

<p>Your IP address has been listed on a RBL (real-time block list)
and marked as an open proxy. This indicates that your server has 
been misconfigured or has been compromised.</p>

<h2>Why would this be bad?</h2>

<p>Depending on the problem, your server can potentially be used by malicous
users on the internet to send spam or do harm to others while using your 
server as a proxy.</p>

<p>If your server remains listed on the RBL you will have trouble sending 
email to certain recipients.</p>

<h2>Recommended action</h2>

<p>In the case of a misconfiguration it could for example be the case 
that your SMTP server is accepting email from untrusted sources and you
will need to reconfigure your SMTP server.</p>

<p>In the case of a compromise your server might have been hacked or infected 
by a trojan.</p>

<p>Once you have resolved the issue, you can request a delisting using the 
URL included in the ticket report.</p>

<h2>Tips to resolve this matter</h2>

<p>You also might want to check and resolve listings on other RBL's, 
using a RBL checker such as: http://www.anti-abuse.org/multi-rbl-check/</p>
