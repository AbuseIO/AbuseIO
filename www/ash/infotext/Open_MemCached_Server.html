<h2>What is an 'Open Memcached Server'?</h2>

Memcached is an in-memory key-value store for small chunks of 
arbitrary data (strings, objects) from results of database calls, 
API calls, or page rendering. Its intended for use in speeding up 
dynamic web applications by alleviating database load

<h2>Why would this be bad?</h2>

The problem is actually pretty simple - memcached is built for speed,
not for security, and it does nothing to secure itself. As far as 
memcache's authors are concerned, this isn't a problem... it just 
means you have to secure it yourself. The problem is the people don't 
do that.

Since its not secure, this means that random people on the internet 
can discover your memcache, read things from it, and even write into 
it. The kinds of security problems that could create are limited only 
by your imagination and the kinds of data you put into your cache.

Lets assume I have an insecure memcache instance running at my.example.com. 
I can log into that server, and connect to my memcache instance with telnet:

[dbock@my.example ~]$ telnet localhost 11211
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to my.example.com (127.0.0.1).
Escape character is '^]'.
add catchphrase 0 0 29
intelligence for sale or rent

and memcache returns : STORED

so far, so good. We just stuck a piece of data into our memcache. but guess 
what? ANYONE, ANYWHERE on the internet can now get that piece of data. Log 
out of your machine and try this from a remote host:

[dbock@my.desktopmachine] ~]$ telnet my.example.com 11211
Trying 192.0.32.10...
Connected to my.example.com (192.0.32.10).
Escape character is '^]'.
get catchphrase

and memcache responds:

VALUE catchphrase 0 29
intelligence for sale or rent
END

Ouch. We just connected to our server and pulled out our super-secret catch 
phrase. We don't want or need memcache to be listening to the outside world.

<h2>Recommende action</h2>

If you are dealing with a multi-server environment, the solution will be more 
complicated than this - you'll want a firewall, a private network, and other 
complexity to separate the 'outside world' from your 'inside world'. If you 
are dealing with one server though, the solution is simple - just don't 
listen to your ethernet connection.

Mysql has an option to specify what address it listens to... so rather than 
listen to everything, we ony want to listen to the localhost - 127.0.0.1

On my CentOS box, I can do this by simply editing the file: /etc/sysconfig/memcached
and changing the line

OPTIONS=""

to

OPTIONS="-l 127.0.0.1"

and restart memcache with

sudo /sbin/service memcached restart

retry the steps above and you'll find that outside the server, telnet can't connect anymore.

The memcached settings file might be someplace else on other linuxes, depending 
on their file conventions... The memcacheinstall for your platform should give 
you a clue where this is, as this file is also needed to specify the amount of 
memory in the cache, etc.
