# AbuseIO 4.1.0 Release notes

## Enhancements

## Changes 

- As of this version any generated token for API, ASH, etc will no longer work due to changes in token generation.
  Once you have upgraded to a new version old tokens willen no longer work. We advice you to send a notification
  to all open tickets which automatically result into sending a new token with the notification.
  e.g.: php artisan housekeeper:notifications --send --force

## Bug fixes

- Fixed: Sorting methods of datatables was not working, due to sort-by/limit-by addition.
