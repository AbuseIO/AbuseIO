<h2>What is an 'Open MongoDB Server'?</h2>

MongoDB is a cross-platform document-oriented database. Classified as a NoSQL database, MongoDB eschews the traditional table-based relational database structure in favor of JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas (MongoDB calls the format BSON), making the integration of data in certain types of applications easier and faster.

<h2>Why would this be bad?</h2>

You system is have a MongoDB NoSQL database (see www.mongodb.org for more information) running which is accessible on the internet. While authentication is available for MongoDB, in many instances this authentication is not enabled.

This enables an attacker, without circumventing any security measures, to get read-and-write access to these databases, many of which contain sensitive customer data or live backends of Web shops

<h2>Recommende action</h2>

Either bind this service only to non-public facing connections or add a firewall to block the port MongoDB is running on.

<h2>Tips to resolve this matter</h2>

The MongoDB service default configuration enables local access only. Its main configuration file is
usually found at:

Linux: /etc/mongodb.conf

BSD: /usr/local/etc/mongodb.conf

Windows: no default path; usually assigned on setup

Many precompiled packages of MongoDB already ship with a default configuration that binds the
service after its installation only to localhost:

bindIp: 127.0.0.1
port: 27017

This allows access from services running on the same physical or virtual host and denies every-
thing else. No other security feature like traffic encryption or access control is enabled by default.
This configuration is acceptable, if the use-case scenario includes only services that need to access
MongoDB from the same host as the database service.

However, a common setup and scalable solution for most Internet services is to have a database
server running on one physical machine, while the services using this database service are (often
virtualized) running on another machine. In this case, the easiest solution is to comment out the
flag 'bind.ip = 127.0.0.1' or to remove it completely, which defaults to accepting all network
connections to the database. If access is possible from untrusted machines (e.g., from the Internet)
outside the trusted network, it is crucial to also set up transfer encryption and proper access control.
